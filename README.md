# Introduction

This is UoA XZEN813's submission for MSA 2019 AI and Machine Learning Assignment.

It includes links to Microsoft's online jupyter notebooks where the results can be viewed quickly by collaborators.

- create an Azure Notebook
- find data to analyse
- wrangle data to prepare it for machine learning
- analyse it to get a gist of what's going on
- run a machine learning model on the data and use the model to make predictions

# Assignment Checklist

- [x] Complete the "intro-to-ml-with-python" exercises on the Microsoft Learn Platform https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/learn/paths/intro-to-ml-with-python/
- [x] Create an Azure notebook (here: https://notebooks.azure.com/)
- [x] Find another dataset (not the one used in this video) [There are some good ones here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php]
- [x] Clean it (remove bad data)
- [x] Analyse it (plot histograms and scatter plots to see what the correlations are like)
- [x] Run a machine learning model on the data
(e.g. Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- [x] Add comments explaining why you performed each step and add comments about any notable observation you make.
